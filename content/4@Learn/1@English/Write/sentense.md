#  How to Write a Sentence



> 句子是英语写作的基础，写出含义清晰、表达简练、语法正确、正式规范的句子



### 1. 如何让句子更清晰



#### 1.1 给出具体内容

**办法：**

1. **避免单独使用意义宽泛、没有具体含义的词。**

**the idea, the meaning, the cont nt, some factors, in many ways, different perspectives, various reasons, different things......**

2. **写出这些词具体包含什么内容/方面。**

   

~ 例句：The meaning of the book is not clear the first time you read it,but after several reading,the meaning comes through.

修改成：The book’s idea  about school safety is not clear when you read for the first time ，the meaning comes through. 

> 如果是用的是“read it at first time”行不行？“at first time”是不正确的表达，应该是“for the first time”，用于表示“第一次”



#### 1.2 补充具体信息

**办法：**

1. **给出具体名称**

**The girl has bought a car. → Emily has bought an Audi**

2. **使用具体的动词、词组**

**He got it. → He found a solution.**

3. **在名词前补充形容词**

**A man opened the box. → A tall man in blue opened the dusty wooden box.**



~ 例句：My roomate is truly horrible.

修改成：My inconsiderate roommate leaves his clothes everywhere,play loud music,and smell terrible.



#### 1.3 避免一概而论

**办法：**

1. ﻿﻿﻿**避免「一杆子打翻一船人」**
   **反间自己：我说的事情100%会发生吗？**
2. ﻿﻿﻿**避免绝对化用词（特 情况除外）**
    **all, every, everyone, no one, only, always, never, impossible, must.**
3. ﻿﻿﻿**补充严谨的修饰语**
    **it is widely accepted/believed that, tend to, usually, often**
    **加上限定的修饰成分**



~ 例句：As we all know ,drinking green tea is good for our health

修改成：It is widely believed that drinking tea may aid weight and digestion

> 如果“aid weight”表达不够准确。那就使用“aid in weight loss”或“aid weight reduction”





#### 1.4 保证主语明确

**突出句子重心，关注真正的主角。**

**<font color="red">主动句</font>vs主动句：意义清晰（谁-做了-什么事），避免句子冗长复杂。**

1. ﻿﻿﻿**Papers need to be bought to teach the students to paint.**

​	<font color="red">The Art Department needs to buy papers to teach students painting.</font>    

2. ﻿﻿﻿**The entrance exam is failed by over one-third of the applicants to the school.**
    <font color="red">Over one-third of the applicants to the school failed the entrance exam.</font>

3. ﻿﻿﻿**By then, the article will have been completely revised by the**

**主动句vs<font color =“red">被动句</font>**

4. **动作发出者不确定或不重要：**

**Every year, thousands of people are diagnosed as having cancer.**

**5． 营造权威语调：**

**Visitors are not allowed after 9:00 p.m.**
